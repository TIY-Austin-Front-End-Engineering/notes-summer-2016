# Day 19 - Constructors

## Review
- adding elements to the DOM with jquery (nested structure)
- event listener that results in ajax request
- data attribute, identifying a particular element's backing data

## Challenge
An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or
non-consecutive. Implement a function that determines whether a
string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty
string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.

```js
//example function calls and their expected outputs:
isIsogram( "Dermatoglyphics" ) == true
isIsogram( "aba" ) == false
isIsogram( "moOse" ) == false // -- ignore letter case
```

## Notes
- Constructors!
  - constructors are functions that are used to create objects
  - constructors are named with capital letters
