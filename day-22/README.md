# Day 22 - Review jQuery SPA, Backbone Router

## Review

## Challenge

## Notes
- getting started/setup
  - clone scaffolding
    - copy `clone with https` url from [here](https://github.com/TIY-Austin-Front-End-Engineering/spa-scaffold)
    - command to clone `git clone <url> <directory to install into>`
      - if you don't specify the directory it will MAKE a new directory as a child of your current location called whatever you are cloning.
  - move into the project directory
  - remove git history of the scaffolding project
    - `rm -rf .git`
  - add a new git repo as you always have done
  - run `npm install` to build your files and start your sever
  - after you see the sever message in the console, check your site at http://localhost:8080
  - work on your project in the app folder
- Draw out wireframes, and make sure you know what your application is going to do on each page
- Do some data modeling for my application
- Stub out some data
- Start writing our code
  - created basic layouts with html (and css)
  - write javascript in the entry.js file. move 'discrete' features to their own modules as you are able.
  - install dependencies as they come up : `npm install --save <packageName>`
  - check code every step of the way as soon as possible, come up with hypothesis about what you expect to see, and troubleshoot when that doesn't happen
  - to create "global variables", but modularly, you can create a module for that data (for example a "session"), and import it anywhere you need it.
