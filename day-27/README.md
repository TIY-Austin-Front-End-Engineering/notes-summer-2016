# Day 27 - Backbone Views

## Review
- server errors
  - 200 it worked
  - 300 no change
  - 400 your request is bad
  - 500 something wrong on the server
  - the Network tab is your friend - you can view all your request headers, all the response headers, any data you send to the server with your request, and the full content of the response from the server as well. it's your best bet for troubleshooting ajax requests
- models/collections
  - generic
    - represent the data of our application
    - keeping the data separate from the visual presentation
  - backbone specific, but also maybe other frameworks as well
    - easier to send and retrieve data from the server
    - other custom functions that modify the data can live on them
    - ability to emit events and be listened to
      - we updated the app to use an actual session Model for login and logout
