# Day 36 - React

## Review
- `this.props.children`
  - use it for a component that we want to wrap around other components (aka that it would have different contents each time it was used)
  - use it for nesting routes in the React Router

## Challenge
Create a 'like' button react component

## Notes
- like button 4 ways
  - input element
  - button element
  - "controlled" input on a react component
    - input elements whose `value` property is set to state and so is controlled by the component's state
  - using callback props
  - using a store
- index routes
  - for creating a child without giving them a name
  - used as the 'default' value for a route with nested children
- passing specific data to callback functions
  - making another component
